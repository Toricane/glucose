# Peter Pan AI Prototype

These are 2 AI prototypes for Peter Pan. They require a Gemini API key to run.

The `main.html` file is a chatbot which provides actionable feedback and suggestions to the user for improving their current glucose level.

The `images.html` file is a chatbot which takes in an image of a fridge and provides meal suggestions for dinner based on the user's current glucose level.

Open the respective HTML files in a browser to run the prototypes. Make sure to replace the placeholder API key with your own!
